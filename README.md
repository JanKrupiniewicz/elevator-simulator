This project simulates the operation of an elevator, implemented in C++ using a simple console-based interface. The elevator system is designed to handle passengers across different floors, considering weight restrictions and movement direction. The elevator enforces a maximum weight limit and prioritizes passengers traveling in the same direction. Statistics are displayed before and after each elevator operation, showing the number of new and deleted passengers on each floor.
